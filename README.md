**CAUTION**: Don't jump into deep water too hastily.

## Part 1. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

- Chapter1- the machine learning landscape. Mainly about the concept Machine Learning, different types of Machine Learning, and so on.
- Chapter2 - end to end machine learning projects. Take the project: House price prediction as an example to illustrate an ML solution from stretch.
