# Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

**CAUTION**: Don't jump into deep water too hastily.

## Part 1. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

- Chapter1- the machine learning landscape. Mainly about the concept Machine Learning, different types of Machine Learning, and so on.
- Chapter2 - end to end machine learning projects. Take the project: House price prediction as an example to illustrate an ML solution from stretch.
- Chapter3 - classification. Turn our attention to classification systems.
- Chapter4 - training the models. Most of the topics discussed in this chapter will be essential in understanding, building, and training neural networks.
- Chapter5 - Support Vector Machines. This chapter will explain the core concepts of SVMs, how to use them, and how they work.
- Chapter6 - Decision Trees. Decision Trees are versatile ML algorithms but also have limitations.
- Chapter7 - In this chapter we will discuss the most popular Ensemble methods, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and a few others. We will also explore Random Forests. 
- Chapter8 - Dimensionality Reduction. In this chapter we will discuss the curse of dimensionality and get a sense of what goes on in high-dimensional space. Then, we will present the two main approaches to dimensionality reduction (projection and Manifold Learning), and we will go through three of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, Kernel PCA, and LLE.
