# Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

**CAUTION**: Don't jump into deep water too hastily.

## Part 1. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

- Chapter1- the machine learning landscape. Mainly about the concept Machine Learning, different types of Machine Learning, and so on.
- Chapter2 - end to end machine learning projects. Take the project: House price prediction as an example to illustrate an ML solution from stretch.
- Chapter3 - classification. Turn our attention to classification systems.
- Chapter4 - training the models. Most of the topics discussed in this chapter will be essential in understanding, building, and training neural networks.
